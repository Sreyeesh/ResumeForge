# Application for Architect Position

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Architect position at Projektbüroo Sport OÜ. With over a decade of experience in 3D modeling, visualization, and technical workflows within the animation and VFX industries, I bring a unique perspective and a strong foundation of transferable skills to architectural design.  

In my previous roles at companies like DNEG and Walt Disney Animation Studios, I utilized tools such as Maya, AutoCAD, Blender, and Python to deliver precise, high-quality 3D models and visualizations. These experiences required collaborating with cross-functional teams, managing complex workflows, and adhering to strict timelines—all skills critical to architectural projects.  

While my background lies primarily in animation and film, my expertise in creating detailed designs, automating workflows, and solving complex challenges translates directly to architectural visualization and project management. Additionally, my self-taught proficiency in ArchiCAD demonstrates my adaptability and eagerness to expand my skill set.  

I am particularly drawn to Projektbüroo Sport OÜ’s commitment to thoughtful and sustainable design. I am confident that my combination of technical proficiency, creative problem-solving, and communication skills positions me to contribute meaningfully to your team.  

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with your needs. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the possibility of joining Projektbüroo Sport OÜ.  

Sincerely,  
**Sreyeesh Garimella**
