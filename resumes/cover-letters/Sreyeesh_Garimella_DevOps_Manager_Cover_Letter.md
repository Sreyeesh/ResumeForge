Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am thrilled to apply for the DevOps Manager position at Datenna. With over 7 years of experience in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering, including 3+ years in leadership roles, I have a proven ability to design and manage scalable cloud infrastructure, lead high-performing teams, and drive innovation in complex technical environments.  

In my recent role as a DevOps Consultant, I successfully implemented multi-cloud strategies across **Azure** and **AWS**, leveraging **Kubernetes** (Helm, ArgoCD), **Terraform**, and **GitOps** methodologies to enhance scalability and reliability. I have a strong background in observability tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, incident management, and capacity planning—skills I am excited to bring to Datenna’s multi-cloud environments.  

Highlights of my expertise that align with the role include:  
- **Team Leadership**: Led a team of senior SREs, fostering a collaborative culture and ensuring alignment with strategic objectives.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Designed and managed Kubernetes-based platforms and containerization strategies to optimize performance and scalability.  
- **Automation**: Implemented infrastructure-as-code solutions to streamline CI/CD pipelines and GitOps practices, reducing deployment times by 40%.  
- **Strategic Planning**: Contributed to long-term technical roadmaps, focusing on cost optimization, security, and infrastructure scaling.  

I am particularly drawn to Datenna’s focus on geopolitical intelligence and innovation in OSINT and AI technologies. The opportunity to lead the evolution of your cloud infrastructure and platform engineering, while mentoring a talented team of engineers, aligns perfectly with my passion for driving reliability, scalability, and security in critical systems.  

I would welcome the chance to discuss how my technical expertise and leadership skills can contribute to Datenna’s mission. Please feel free to contact me at [sgarime1@gmail.com](mailto:sgarime1@gmail.com) or [+372 5827 7155](tel:+37258277155) to arrange a conversation.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team’s success.  

Best regards,  
**Sreyeesh Garimella**
