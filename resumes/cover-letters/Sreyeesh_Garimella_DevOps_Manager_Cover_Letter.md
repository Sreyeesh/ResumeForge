Datenna’s commitment to geopolitical intelligence and its focus on OSINT and AI technologies align with my passion for impactful, cutting-edge projects.  

In my previous roles, I successfully:  
- Led a team of senior SREs and engineers, ensuring scalability, security, and reliability across **AWS** and **Azure** platforms.  
- Designed and managed Kubernetes-based platforms using **Helm**, **ArgoCD**, and **Crossplane**, optimizing containerization strategies.  
- Implemented infrastructure-as-code solutions with **Terraform** to automate deployments and improve operational efficiency.  
- Developed CI/CD pipelines and adopted GitOps practices, reducing deployment times by 40%.  
- Enhanced system transparency and reliability through observability tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, minimizing downtime by 35%.  

Datenna’s mission to innovate in geopolitical intelligence resonates with my experience delivering secure, scalable systems that support critical services. My expertise in Kubernetes, multi-cloud infrastructure, and leadership uniquely positions me to shape your infrastructure strategy and foster a strong DevOps culture.
