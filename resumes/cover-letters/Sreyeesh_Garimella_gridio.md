## **Subject:** Application for Backend Engineer Position  

Dear Hiring Team,  

I am excited to apply for the **Backend Engineer** position at **Gridio**. My extensive experience as a backend developer in the animation and VFX industry has prepared me to excel in building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems—just like the solutions Gridio creates to optimize energy consumption and empower smart devices.  

At major studios such as **Disney**, **Blizzard Entertainment**, and **Boulder Media**, I developed and maintained backend systems used by over **1,000 artists and administrators**. These systems handled critical workflows, large-scale data processing, and API integrations, ensuring seamless production pipelines and scalability. My experience translates directly to Gridio’s focus on creating robust backend solutions, integrating APIs, and managing distributed systems.  

### **Why My Experience Fits Gridio’s Needs**  
- **Backend Expertise**: I’ve developed backend systems using **Python** and **Golang**, with a focus on clean code, microservices, and REST API integration.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: I’ve deployed scalable backend systems on **AWS**, leveraging CI/CD pipelines (**GitLab**, **Jenkins**) to ensure efficient development cycles.  
- **API Integration**: My work involved integrating complex APIs, such as those used for inter-device communication, much like the automotive and energy APIs Gridio integrates.  
- **Scalability and Reliability**: I am skilled at designing systems that handle high traffic and large-scale operations, ensuring stability and performance in mission-critical environments.  

### **Passion for Renewable Energy**  
Gridio’s mission to revolutionize energy consumption aligns with my own values. I am passionate about leveraging technology to make systems smarter, greener, and more efficient. I am particularly excited about contributing to projects like distributed optimization algorithms and integrating energy devices such as EVs and solar inverters into a smarter grid.  

I would be thrilled to bring my expertise in backend development, scalability, and API integrations to your innovative team. Please find attached my resume for more details on my experience. You can also explore examples of my work on my [GitHub portfolio](https://github.com/sreyeesh).  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to Gridio’s mission to shape the future of clean energy.
