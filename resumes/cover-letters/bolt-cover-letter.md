Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** position at Bolt. With a strong background in building and maintaining scalable, reliable systems, I bring over a decade of experience in infrastructure automation, performance optimization, and collaborative problem-solving to ensure seamless operations in dynamic environments.

In my current role as a Site Reliability Engineer at SG Production OÜ, I have:

- **Automated infrastructure** using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform to improve deployment efficiency and scalability.
- Developed **monitoring systems** with Prometheus and Grafana, reducing downtime and enabling proactive performance optimization.
- Designed and implemented **CI/CD pipelines** with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, streamlining code integration and deployment.

Previously, at Blizzard Entertainment, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to optimize game engine performance and implemented automated alerting mechanisms to resolve production issues swiftly. Across all my roles, I have emphasized reliability, availability, and scalability—aligning closely with Bolt’s mission to deliver world-class solutions at scale.

Your commitment to transforming urban mobility through innovative technology resonates deeply with me. I am particularly impressed by Bolt’s emphasis on scalable backend systems and data-driven decision-making, areas where I have consistently contributed value.

I would welcome the opportunity to bring my expertise to Bolt’s SRE team and contribute to maintaining and scaling the infrastructure that powers your impactful solutions.
