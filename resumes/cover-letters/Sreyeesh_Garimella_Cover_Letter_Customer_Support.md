Dear Hiring Team,  

I am excited to apply for the Customer Support Specialist position at Finnair Business Services in Tartu. With over 10 years of experience in technical problem-solving, workflow optimization, and customer service, I am confident in my ability to deliver exceptional support to your customers and contribute positively to your team.  

In my role as the owner of SG Production OÜ, I managed customer inquiries, optimized workflows, and implemented solutions that improved service delivery efficiency. I worked with tools like Salesforce and ShotGrid to streamline operations and ensure compliance with service-level agreements. Additionally, my experience collaborating with global clients, including leading animation studios such as Disney and Blizzard Entertainment, has honed my communication and problem-resolution skills, even in high-pressure environments.  

Key achievements that align with this role include:  
- Successfully managing customer inquiries, refunds, and workflow improvements, achieving a 30% reduction in response times through process optimization.  
- Streamlining communication between teams to ensure seamless service delivery and customer satisfaction.  
- Quickly adapting to new systems and tools, enabling me to learn and implement advanced CRM solutions like Salesforce effectively.  

I am fluent in English and eager to learn new platforms, including Amadeus, to better serve Finnair’s customers. I value teamwork, innovation, and a customer-first mindset, all of which I see reflected in Finnair’s approach.  

Joining Finnair would be an incredible opportunity to combine my technical expertise and passion for customer service in a dynamic, international environment. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team’s success and enhancing the customer experience.
