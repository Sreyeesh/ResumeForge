Dear Hiring Team at EPAM,

I am excited to apply for the Engineering Manager position at EPAM. With over a decade of experience in software development, Python engineering, and team leadership, I am eager to contribute to your mission of delivering innovative solutions and fostering a collaborative, inclusive culture.

In my previous role as a DevOps and Multi-Disciplinary IT Consultant, I successfully led cross-functional teams to design and implement scalable CI/CD pipelines, reducing deployment times by 30%. At Smartmatic-Cybernetica, I architected secure cloud-native infrastructures using Docker and AWS EC2, enhancing system reliability through Python automation. These experiences have honed my expertise in Python development, agile methodologies, and strategic problem-solving, enabling me to drive projects that align with business goals and exceed quality standards.

Beyond my technical achievements, I am passionate about mentorship and building high-performing teams. I have established peer-review systems to enhance collaboration and initiated skill development programs to empower engineers to achieve their fullest potential. I take pride in fostering environments where innovation and continuous learning thrive.

EPAM’s commitment to embracing dynamic and inclusive cultures resonates deeply with me. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to collaborate with multi-national teams, contribute to transformative projects, and leverage emerging technologies to drive global impact.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in Python engineering, leadership, and strategic planning aligns with EPAM’s goals. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your talented team.

Best regards,

Sreyeesh Garimella
